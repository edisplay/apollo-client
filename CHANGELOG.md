## 2.3.4 (June 13, 2018)

### Apollo Client (2.3.4)

- Export the `QueryOptions` interface, to make sure it can be used by other
  projects (like `apollo-angular`).
- Fixed an issue caused by typescript changes to the constructor
  `defaultOptions` param, that prevented `query` defaults from passing type
  checks.
  ([@hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) in [#3585](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/pull/3585))

### Apollo Boost (0.1.9)

- No changes

### Apollo Cache In-Memory (1.2.4)

- No changes

### Apollo Utilities (1.0.15)

- No changes

### Apollo GraphQL Anywhere (4.1.13)

- No changes


## 2.3.3 (June 13, 2018)

### Apollo Client (2.3.3)

- Typescript improvements. Made observable query parameterized on data and
  variables: `ObservableQuery<TData, TVariables>`
  ([@excitement-engineer](https://github.com/excitement-engineer) in [#3140](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/pull/3140))
- Added optional generics to cache manipulation methods (typescript).
  ([@mvestergaard](https://github.com/mvestergaard) in [#3541](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/pull/3541))  
- Typescript improvements. Created a new `QueryOptions` interface that  
  is now used by `ApolloClient.query` options, instead of the previous
  `WatchQueryOptions` interface. This helps reduce confusion (especially
  in the docs) that made it look like `ApolloClient.query` accepted
  `ApolloClient.watchQuery` only options, like `pollingInterval`.
  ([@hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) in [#3569](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/pull/3569))

### Apollo Boost (0.1.8)

- Allow `cache` to be given as a configuration option to `ApolloBoost`.
  ([@dandean](https://github.com/dandean) in [#3561](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/pull/3561))
- Allow `headers` and `credentials` to be passed in as configuration
  parameters to the `apollo-boost` `ApolloClient` constructor.
  ([@rzane](https://github.com/rzane) in [#3098](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/pull/3098))

### Apollo Cache (1.1.10)

- Added optional generics to cache manipulation methods (typescript).
  ([@mvestergaard](https://github.com/mvestergaard) in [#3541](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/pull/3541))

### Apollo Cache In-Memory (1.2.3)

- Added optional generics to cache manipulation methods (typescript).
  ([@mvestergaard](https://github.com/mvestergaard) in [#3541](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/pull/3541))
- Restore non-enumerability of `resultFields[ID_KEY]`.
  ([@benjamn](https://github.com/benjamn) in [#3544](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/pull/3544))
- Cache query documents transformed by InMemoryCache.
  ([@benjamn](https://github.com/benjamn) in [#3553](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/pull/3553))

### Apollo Utilities (1.0.14)

- Store key names generated by `getStoreKeyName` now leverage a more
  deterministic approach to handling JSON based strings. This prevents store
  key names from differing when using `args` like
  `{ prop1: 'value1', prop2: 'value2' }` and
  `{ prop2: 'value2', prop1: 'value1' }`.
  ([@gdi2290](https://github.com/gdi2290) in [#2869](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/pull/2869))
- Avoid needless `hasOwnProperty` check in `deepFreeze`.
  ([@benjamn](https://github.com/benjamn) in [#3545](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/pull/3545))

### Apollo GraphQL Anywhere (4.1.12)

- No new changes.


## 2.3.2 (May 29, 2018)

### Apollo Client (2.3.2)

- Fix SSR and `cache-and-network` fetch policy
  ([@dastoori](https://github.com/dastoori) in [#3372](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/pull/3372))
- Fixed an issue where the `updateQuery` method passed to
  `ObservableQuery.fetchMore` was receiving the original query variables,
  instead of the new variables that it used to fetch more data.
  ([@abhiaiyer91](https://github.com/abhiaiyer91) in [#3500](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/pull/3500))
- Fixed an issue involving `Object.setPrototypeOf()` not working on JSC
  (Android), by instead setting the `prototype` of `this` manually.
  ([@seklyza](https://github.com/seklyza) in [#3306](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/pull/3306))
- Added safeguards to make sure `QueryStore.initQuery` and   
  `QueryStore.markQueryResult` don't try to set the network status of a
  `fetchMoreForQueryId` query, if it does not exist in the store. This was
  happening when a query component was unmounted while a `fetchMore` was still
  in flight.  
  ([@conrad-vanl](https://github.com/conrad-vanl) in [#3367](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/pull/3367), [@doomsower](https://github.com/doomsower) in [#3469](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/pull/3469))

### Apollo Boost (0.1.7)

- Various internal code cleanup, tooling and dependency changes.

### Apollo Cache (1.1.9)

- Various internal code cleanup, tooling and dependency changes.

### Apollo Cache In-Memory (1.2.2)

- Fixed an issue that caused fragment only queries to sometimes fail.
  ([@abhiaiyer91](https://github.com/abhiaiyer91) in [#3507](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/pull/3507))
- Fixed cache invalidation for inlined mixed types in union fields within
  arrays.
  ([@dferber90](https://github.com/dferber90) in [#3422](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/pull/3422))

### Apollo Utilities (1.0.13)

- Make `maybeDeepFreeze` a little more defensive, by always using
  `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` (to avoid cases where the object being
  frozen doesn't have its own `hasOwnProperty`).
  ([@jorisroling](https://github.com/jorisroling) in [#3418](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/pull/3418))
- Remove certain small internal caches to prevent memory leaks when using SSR.
  ([@brunorzn](https://github.com/brunorzn) in [#3444](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/pull/3444))

### Apollo GraphQL Anywhere (4.1.11)

- Source files are now excluded when publishing to npm.
  ([@hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) in [#3454](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/pull/3454))
